Variables are just like containers which hold the values while the program is executed.
A variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), 
which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.
Variables in Java are strongly typed; thus they all must have a data type declared with their identifier.
Variables, once declared in the program, are allocated space in memory. 
Memory itself is organized as a long collection of one byte after another. 
These bytes are sequentially numbered, with the number being referred to as a memory address for the corresponding location.
It is customary to use hexadecimal numbers to show the addresses of memory locations.
