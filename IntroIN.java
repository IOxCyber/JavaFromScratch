A Java program is structured in a specific and particular manner. 
Java is a language and therefore has grammar similar to a spoken language like English.
It is Simple & Portable: Memory Management using Pointers is not allowed.
It is Object-Oriented.
It is Independent of the host platform means it compiles differently for different Operating System.
It is Secured & Dynamic: Designed to execute code from remote sources securely.
It contains language facilities and libraries for Networking.
Java gives High Performance: With the use of JIT (Just-In-Time) compilers.
Java achieves high performance through the use of byte-code that can be easily translated into native machine code.
It is Robust: Java has its own strong memory management system. This helps to eliminate errors as it checks the code during compile and runtime.
Java is Multithreaded: It supports multiple executions of threads (i.e., lightweight processes), including a set of synchronization primitives.


//Bad Practices in Java
Use of Pointers
Operator overloading
Multiple inheritance
Friend classes (access another objectâ€™s private members)
Restrictions of explicit type casting (related to memory management)
