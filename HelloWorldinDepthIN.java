//Java is an object-oriented programming language. 
//Therefore, every line that needs to be executed should be inside a class. This line declares a class HelloWorld.

   class HelloWorld {//class HelloWorld is the class declaration.

        System.out.println("Hello World!");//Gives processor the command to output the literal specified in the double quotes ("") and adds a new line to the console. In this case, Hello World! is printed.
      //System.out.print() prints the content and does not add the new line.
   }//A block of code is defined with the { } tokens. { signifies the start of a block of code, â€‹and } signifies the end.
